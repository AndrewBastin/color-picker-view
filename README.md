# ColorPickerView
##### A simple good looking color picker component for Android

A color picker is something that has always been missing from the standard set of components which developers can build their user interface in Android with. This is a color picker which I wrote for one of my own project which I decided to release as open source.

### How to use
The color picker library can be used as a library project, please checkout the code and the demo app for information on how to use it.

There are basicly three different ways to use this color picker. You can add it to your preferences using the ColorPickerPreference class. You can also use it as a dialog using the ColorPickerDialog class. Or you can simply use the ColorPickerView to add the color picker anywhere you want in you application. All three cases are demonstrated in the demo app, please refer to the demo for information on how to use it.
